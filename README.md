# Machine-Learning-Project-With-Deployement

This Particular Machine Learning Project Was Attempted In Our Early First Year Of CSE Which Was Based On The Fact That Teenagers Tend To Have Confusion In Deciding Which Field/Hobby They Fit In Or Love To Do , So We Attempted In Making Classification Model Which Could Help The Parents In Deciding Their Child's Area Of Interest.

Classification Algorithm:
We Implemented Support Vector Classification Algorithm, In Short we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the classes very well, Well to find the right hyper-plane we maximize the distances between nearest data point (either class) and hyper-plane will help us to decide the right hyper-plane. This distance is called as Margin.
